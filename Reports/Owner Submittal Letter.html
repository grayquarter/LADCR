            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                An application has been submitted with the Bureau of Cannabis Control
                (BCC) to obtain a [RECORD_TYPE]. You are listed as a business owner on
                this application. For the application to be considered, you must complete
                an owner submittal form with the Bureau (see below).
                <br>
                <br>
                The Application ID is <b>[TEMPLATE_ID]</b>. You will need to provide this information
                on the owner submittal form.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to the completed owner submittal form, you will be required
                to provide the following documents:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Copy of a Government-Issued Identification (acceptable forms of identification
                        are a document issued by the Federal, state, county, or municipal government
                        that includes the name, date of birth, physical description, and a picture
                        of the person, such as a driver’s license.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A live scan form
                        <span class="BCCHyperlink const-livescan-url"></span>
                        for fingerprint imaging must be submitted through a live scan operator
                        to the Department of Justice. Take the live scan form with you to the Live
                        Scan Site for fingerprint submissions to the DOJ and FBI. You must complete
                        your personal identification information on the form prior to submitting
                        to the live scan operator; all fields must be completed. Your name, social
                        security number and date of birth must be identical to that submitted on
                        your owner submittal. To facilitate prompt and accurate processing, please
                        TYPE or print legibly all requested information. Once your prints have
                        been scanned, the Live Scan operator will complete the ATI Number and return
                        the second and third copies to you with this information. Keep a copy of
                        the Live Scan form. You may call the DOJ automated system at 916-227-4557
                        to check the status of your live scan fingerprint response results. You
                        will need the ATI number which is in the bottom section of the Live Scan
                        form that the Live Scan Operator completed and your date of birth to obtain
                        information about the status of your fingerprint responses. The following
                        is a link to the State of California Department of Justice’s website to
                        find live scan operator’s.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                You may submit your owner submittal in the following ways:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Online at the following link:
                        <span class="BCCHyperlink const-aca-owner-url"></span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mail by downloading the form here:
                        <span class="BCCHyperlink const-owner-paper-form"></span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                If an application is not completed within one year from date the applicant
                was first notified by the Bureau, the application will be considered abandoned
                and the application fee will not be refunded. Once an application is considered
                abandoned, to obtain a license, the applicant will be required to submit
                a new application, pay the appropriate application fee, and be live-scanned.
                <br>

                Thank you,
